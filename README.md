# VRay Light Lister
Replace the built-in 3D Studio Max light lister with one that supports **VRay Lights** and **VRay Suns**. For VRay 1.5 and up.

## Installing
To install, backup `C:\3DSMaxDirectory\UI\MacroScripts\Macro_LightList.mcr` and replace it with the file included in this package. You will need to restart 3DSMax to see the change.

## Legal Disclaimer
No warranty or support is offered or implied and you assume all liabilities from using the script. Use at your own risk. That said, this has been tested on 3DSMax 8 sp3 with Vray 1.5r2
